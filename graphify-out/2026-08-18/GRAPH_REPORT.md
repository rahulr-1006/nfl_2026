## Graph Freshness
- Built from commit: `e277c68d`
- Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and compare to check if the graph is stale.
- Run `graphify update .` after code changes (no API cost).

## Knowledge Gaps
- **93 isolated node(s):** `Status`, `Data chronology: nflverse (historical) vs. Pinnacle (live)`, `Live monitoring: 24/7 services + SMS alerts`, `Preseason dry run`, `Historical props for backtesting — checked, blocked on paid access` (+88 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components.
- **16 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `PointInTimeStore` connect `PointInTimeStore` to `Side`, `scheduler.py`, `transform.py`, `market_baseline`, `OddsApiClient`, `test_props_scheduler.py`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.130) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `settle_prop_snapshots()` connect `test_prop_settlement.py` to `test_pass_rush_elo.py`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.082) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `build_player_stats_index()` connect `test_prop_settlement.py` to `test_pass_rush_elo.py`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.081) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 45 inferred relationships involving `PointInTimeStore` (e.g. with `BacktestEngine` and `clv_movement_report()`) actually correct?**
  _`PointInTimeStore` has 45 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 51 inferred relationships involving `Side` (e.g. with `BacktestBet` and `BetOrder`) actually correct?**
  _`Side` has 51 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 42 inferred relationships involving `Market` (e.g. with `BacktestBet` and `BetOrder`) actually correct?**
  _`Market` has 42 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 23 inferred relationships involving `OddsApiClient` (e.g. with `main()` and `poll_once()`) actually correct?**
  _`OddsApiClient` has 23 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
